This project is about a birthday celebration web page. Here are some key points about the project:

* index.html: The main HTML file for the birthday web page.
* styles1.css: An external CSS file for styling the web page.
* Sweet(chosic.com).mp3: An audio file used for playing a birthday song.
* bday1.html: Another HTML file linked from index.html for additional content or surprises.

Purpose: The Birthday_Project folder is dedicated to creating a web page that celebrates a birthday with a special message, audio playback, and a link to additional content.

Technologies Used:

* HTML for structuring the web page.
* CSS for styling the web page.
* JavaScript (inline) for controlling the audio playback.
  
This project is likely used for learning and experimenting with frontend web development concepts and techniques and also to deliver special birthday wishes to someone special.
